# Introduction 
This repository holds recruitment tests or challenges that we ask candidates to do as part of the technical interview process.

The Sales Tax challenge has existing code to work from (in a few different languages,) the rest are just instructions.

**DO NOT SHARE THE WHOLE REPO** with candidates. This is our IP, if they interview multiple times we don't want them to have already seen all of our tests.

# Contribute
Make a Pull request, and go for it. However, as these are very public facing and we need to provide consistency across the board, please check before making significant changes so that others are aware of any changes prior to performing any form of candidate assessment (whether live interview or remote challenge).

## SalesTax Challenge

This challenge is typically offered to candidates during a live technical interview (remote or in person) where the interviewer observes the candidate attempt to 'fix' the SalesTax application to meet the requirements in outlined in the ```Instructions and Tests.txt``` file included with each version. Each language version is extremely similar but maybe slightly different for each language.
